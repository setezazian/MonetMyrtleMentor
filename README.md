# MentorUp

## Background
This project was a brief 1-week sprint where our team built a fullstack web application from scratch for an external user. 

- Shirin Etezazian - Product Manager & Software Engineer
- Jason West - Architecture Owner & Software Engineer

## Concept
MentorUp is a fullstack web app that allows mentors and mentees to find each other, and learn from each other. 
Users are able to signup as a mentor, list their offerings, and manage their schedule. Mentees can search offerings, book, and message mentors.
