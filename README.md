## Concept

MentorUp is a full stack web app that allows mentors and mentees to find each other, and learn from each other.

- Users are able to sign up as a mentor, list their offerings, and manage their schedule.
- All users are able to create a profile, search offerings, book, and message mentors.

## Primary Tech Stack
- ReactJS
  - Frontend javascript framework used to build the user interface.
- React Router
  - Complementary library to ReactJS responsible for conditionally rendering the app's views based on the current URL.
- Babel
  - Transpilation package used to convert ReactJS-specific syntax into browser-consumable JavaScript.
- Webpack
  - Bundling package used to bundle javascript modules and component-focused stylesheets into .js and .css bundles for browser consumption.
